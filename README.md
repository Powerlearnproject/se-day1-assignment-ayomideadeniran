Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain software engineering and its importance:
Software engineering ensures reliable, efficient, and customer-centric software products, driving innovation, competitiveness, and economic growth.
Identify three key milestones in software engineering evolution:
Waterfall Methodology (1970s): Organized development into steps.
Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s): Emphasized flexibility and collaboration.
DevOps and CI/CD (2000s-present): Automated and streamlined processes.
Describe the Software Development Life Cycle phases:
Planning: Define project scope and goals.
Analysis: Gather software requirements.
Design: Create architectural and detailed designs.
Implementation: Write and test code.
Testing: Verify software meets requirements.
Deployment: Release software to production.
Maintenance: Update, fix, and refine software.
Compare Waterfall and Agile methodologies:
Waterfall: Linear, phase-by-phase approach for predictable projects.
Agile: Iterative, incremental approach for evolving requirements.
Describe roles and responsibilities:
Software Developer: Designs, develops, and tests software code.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Develops testing plans and ensures quality.
Project Manager: Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery.
Discuss IDEs and VCS importance:
IDEs (Eclipse, Visual Studio): Boost productivity with coding tools.
VCS (Git, SVN): Track changes and collaborate on code.
Common challenges and strategies:
Complexity: Break down systems into smaller components.
Time Pressure: Prioritize tasks and minimize distractions.
Collaboration: Foster open dialogue and clear documentation.
Technological Change: Stay updated through courses and industry events.
Explain testing types and importance:
Unit Testing: Verifies individual code components.
Integration Testing: Ensures multiple units work together.
System Testing: Tests entire software system.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms system meets customer requirements.
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering:
Designing and optimizing text prompts for effective AI interactions.
Explain prompt engineering importance:
Improves accuracy, enhances user experience, increases efficiency, and supports better decision-making.
Improve a vague prompt:
Vague: "Write something about AI."
Improved: "Write a concise overview (150-200 words) of AI applications and limitations in healthcare, including two specific examples.
